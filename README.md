## Internship Details  

### Data Science Internship  
During this internship, I worked on analyzing datasets, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), and building predictive models. Key highlights include:  
- Cleaning and preprocessing raw datasets.  
- Performing feature engineering to extract meaningful insights.  
- Visualizing data trends and relationships using Python libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn.  
- Building regression and classification models for solving real-world problems.  

### Machine Learning Internship  
This internship focused on implementing machine learning algorithms to build intelligent systems. Key highlights include:  
- Implementing supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and K-Means Clustering.  
- Building neural networks and applying them to real-world datasets.  
- Evaluating model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.  
- Optimizing hyperparameters to improve model accuracy using tools like GridSearchCV.
