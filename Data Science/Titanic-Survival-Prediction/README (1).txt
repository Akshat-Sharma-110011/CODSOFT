## Titanic Survival Prediction via Multiple Machine Learning Models

### Overview
This project analyzes the Titanic dataset to predict passenger survival using various machine learning models. It demonstrates the application of multiple classification algorithms, compares their performance, and evaluates the factors influencing survival predictions.

### Project Structure
The notebook is divided into the following sections:

1. **Introduction**
   - Provides background on the Titanic disaster and the purpose of the project.

2. **Dataset Overview**
   - Describes the Titanic dataset, its features, and preprocessing steps required for analysis.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Includes visualizations and statistical summaries to understand data distributions and relationships.

4. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Covers handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.

5. **Model Implementation**
   - Implements the following machine learning models:
     - Logistic Regression
     - Decision Tree Classifier
     - Random Forest Classifier
     - Gradient Boosting Classifier
     - AdaBoost Classifier
     - Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
     - XGBoost Classifier

6. **Model Evaluation**
   - Uses metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC to evaluate model performance.

7. **Conclusion**
   - Summarizes findings and highlights the best-performing model(s).

### How to Use

4. Run the cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis and predictions.

### Dataset
The Titanic dataset is sourced from [Kaggle's Titanic Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic). It includes the following features:
- **PassengerId**: Unique identifier for each passenger.
- **Survived**: Survival status (1 = Survived, 0 = Did Not Survive).
- **Pclass**: Ticket class (1st, 2nd, 3rd).
- **Name**: Passenger name.
- **Sex**: Gender.
- **Age**: Age in years.
- **SibSp**: Number of siblings/spouses aboard.
- **Parch**: Number of parents/children aboard.
- **Ticket**: Ticket number.
- **Fare**: Passenger fare.
- **Cabin**: Cabin number.
- **Embarked**: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton).

### Key Features and Insights
- The notebook provides a thorough comparison of machine learning models.
- Hyperparameter tuning is conducted to optimize model performance.
- Feature importance is evaluated to identify key factors affecting survival.

### Results
- Each model's performance is documented and compared using visualizations and metrics.
- The best-performing model(s) are highlighted based on evaluation results.
