## CodSoft Data Science Internship: Project Overview  

This document provides an in-depth overview of the tasks undertaken during my data science internship at **CodSoft**. Throughout this internship, I worked on a variety of projects, showcasing my expertise in data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and machine learning model development. Each task was aimed at solving real-world problems using data science methodologies. Below is a detailed description of each task, including the workflow, tools, and methodologies applied.

### 1. Titanic Survival Prediction  

#### **Objective:**  
Predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic based on demographic and travel information.  

#### **Workflow:**  
1. **Data Preprocessing:**  
   - Handled missing values (e.g., age, embarked) using mean/mode imputation.  
   - Converted categorical data (e.g., gender, embarked) into numerical using one-hot encoding.  
   - Scaled numerical features to improve model performance.  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
   - Identified key patterns and correlations (e.g., survival rate by gender, class).  
   - Visualized data using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn.  

3. **Model Development:**  
   - Tested models: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests.  
   - Achieved optimal accuracy using Random Forest with hyperparameter tuning.  

4. **Evaluation:**  
   - Used accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score for performance metrics.  
   - Achieved ~81% accuracy on test data.

### 2. Credit Card Fraud Detection  

#### **Objective:**  
Detect fraudulent transactions in credit card data using machine learning techniques.  

#### **Workflow:**  
1. **Data Preprocessing:**  
   - Addressed class imbalance using SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique).  
   - Scaled features to standardize numerical values.  

2. **EDA:**  
   - Analyzed patterns in fraudulent vs. legitimate transactions.  
   - Highlighted key features contributing to fraud detection.  

3. **Model Development:**  
   - Used supervised learning models: Logistic Regression, XGBoost, and Random Forest.  
   - Optimized XGBoost for best performance.  

4. **Evaluation:**  
   - Focused on precision and recall due to imbalanced data.  
   - Achieved ~98% precision and ~95% recall with XGBoost.

### 3. Iris Flower Detection  

#### **Objective:**  
Classify iris flowers into three species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) based on sepal and petal dimensions.  

#### **Workflow:**  
1. **Data Preprocessing:**  
   - Checked for missing values and anomalies (none found).  
   - Standardized data to normalize feature scales.  

2. **EDA:**  
   - Visualized feature distributions and species separability using pair plots and histograms.  

3. **Model Development:**  
   - Used k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Decision Trees.  
   - Achieved highest accuracy (~96%) using SVM with radial kernel.  

4. **Evaluation:**  
   - Confusion matrix and classification report validated model performance.

### 4. Movie Rating Prediction  

#### **Objective:**  
Predict movie ratings based on features such as genre, budget, and user reviews.  

#### **Workflow:**  
1. **Data Preprocessing:**  
   - Cleaned and standardized data (e.g., handling missing values in user reviews and budget).  
   - Encoded categorical features like genre using one-hot encoding.  

2. **EDA:**  
   - Explored relationships between budget, genre, and ratings.  
   - Used visualizations to identify trends.  

3. **Model Development:**  
   - Tested regression models: Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Random Forest Regressor.  
   - Ridge Regression provided the best balance between accuracy and interpretability.  

4. **Evaluation:**  
   - Used Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) as evaluation metrics.  
   - Achieved RMSE of ~0.8 on test data.

### 5. House Sales Prediction  

#### **Objective:**  
Predict house prices based on various factors like size, location, and amenities.  

#### **Workflow:**  
1. **Data Preprocessing:**  
   - Addressed missing data in features like lot size and year built.  
   - Applied log transformation to skewed features like price.  

2. **EDA:**  
   - Correlation analysis highlighted features like location and size as key predictors.  
   - Visualized price trends using heatmaps and scatter plots.  

3. **Model Development:**  
   - Implemented Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM), Random Forest, and Linear Regression.  
   - Gradient Boosting Regressor achieved the best performance after hyperparameter tuning.  

4. **Evaluation:**  
   - Focused on MAE, RMSE, and R-squared metrics.  
   - Achieved an R-squared value of ~0.89 on test data.
